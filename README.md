# Flight-price-predictor
machine learning project to predict flight prices of all airlines
AIM OF THE PROJECT 
To display predicted prices of all airlines  based on users input of flight details so that people can make informed choices for air travel.
This model has been trained to take into account booking during holidays like diwali holi(increase in prices) etc and also connectivity of different areas. 
I have shown corelation matrix of all attributes and have shown graph wherever its needed to make it easier to visualise the importance of different factors.
